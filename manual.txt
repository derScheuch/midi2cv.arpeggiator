# arpOli Eurorack Arpeggiator User Manual

Welcome to the comprehensive user manual for the **arpOli** Eurorack Arpeggiator module. This guide aims to provide you with detailed insights into the functionalities and capabilities of arpOli for enhancing your Eurorack modular system.

## MIDI Input and Controls

arpOli is designed to recognize and respond to the following MIDI commands and controls:

- Note On/Off
- Velocity
- Pitch Bend
- Modulation Wheel
- Aftertouch
- Sustain Pedal

Playable notes range from C2 to C6, translating into corresponding voltage levels. Both CV and EXPR (Expression) output voltages are constrained to a maximum of 4V. Please note that MIDI clock functionality is currently inactive.

## Switches and Controls

1. **Switch 1: Mode Selection**
   - Single Mode: In this mode, arpOli functions as a standard MIDI-to-CV interface, playing a single note.
   - Automatic Modes: This mode enables arpeggios (arpeggio mode) or a programmed sequence (sequencer mode) playback.
   - CV voltage output is dependent on the played note and pitch bend.

2. **Potentiometer 1: Arpeggio Patterns (Arpeggio Mode)**
   - In arpeggio mode, the potentiometer value influences various arpeggio patterns.
   - This potentiometer remains inactive in single or sequencer mode.
   - Refer below for details on arpeggio pattern explanation and customization.

3. **Potentiometer 2: Note Playback Speed (Automatic Modes)**
   - Governs the speed of note playback in automatic modes.
   - In the presence of an external clock/trigger signal (Jack 4), the potentiometer assumes the role of a clock divider/multiplier.
   - This potentiometer has no impact in Single mode.

4. **Potentiometer 3: Note Gate Length (Automatic Mode)**
   - Determines the length of a note's gate in automatic mode.
   - The gate length calculation is contingent upon the interval between two successive notes.
   - While awaiting further details on this, fully rotating clockwise extends the gate slightly beyond the interval between two notes. Conversely, a full anticlockwise rotation results in a brief gate of 10ms.

5. **Switch 2: Mode Modification**
   - Arpeggio Mode Up/Down: Choose between normal and special arpeggio modes.
   - Single Mode Up/Down: Opt for regular or special single note modes.
   - Sequencer Mode Up/Down: Select between typical and specialized sequencer modes.

6. **Switch 3: Special Modes**
   - These modes are accessible when the mode modifier switch is set to the down position.
   - Various special arpeggio, single note, and sequencer mode variations are available.

7. **Switch 4: Sequencer Mode Activation**
   - This switch activates the sequencer mode for step sequencing.

8. **Jack 1: CV Output**
   - The CV output jack transmits the corresponding CV signal for the played note.

9. **Jack 2: Expression Output**
   - The expression output jack's voltage varies based on the current mode and MIDI events (velocity, modulation wheel, aftertouch).
   - The maximum voltage output is limited to 4V.

10. **Jack 3: Gate Output**
    - The gate output is triggered when at least one note is played (either in single or automatic mode).
    - In single mode, the gate is turned off if no key is pressed or the sustain pedal is engaged.
    - In automatic modes, the gate deactivation is subject to the gate length calculation (Potentiometer 3).

11. **Jack 4: Clock Input**
    - On a rising edge signal, the clock mode is initiated.
    - This mode regulates the speed of automatic modes, incorporating the clock divider/multiplier functionality explained for Potentiometer 2.
    - The clock mode remains active until no signal changes are detected for a duration of eight seconds.

12. **Config Button**
    - The Config Button serves a multifaceted purpose, enabling various settings and configurations.
    - Pressed with a single note played: Sets the expression mode to velocity.
    - Pressed while significantly manipulating the modulation wheel: Sets the expression mode to modulation wheel.
    - Pressed after exerting substantial aftertouch: Establishes the expression mode as aftertouch.
    - Pressed alongside engaging the sustain pedal: Activates the arpeggiator hold mode (details below).
    - Pressed upon releasing the sustain pedal: Deactivates the arpeggiator hold mode.
    - (To be tested) Pressed while playing an interval on the keyboard: Sets the pitch bend range to the interval between the notes (default is 2).

13. **Arpeggiator Hold Mode**
    - This mode functions as a virtual sustain pedal when in arpeggiator mode.
    - Any pressed or released note is sustained until a new single note is played.
    - For example, playing a chord and releasing all keys will still maintain the arpeggio until a new chord or note is played.

14. **Sequencer Mode**
    - Upon switching the sequencer switch, you automatically enter sequencer mode_stop.
    - This serves as a convenient reset mechanism for arpOli, clearing note buffers and modes in cases where MIDI note off or sustain pedal off events were not detected.
    - To record a new sequence, press the Config Mode Button once and play your step sequencer notes.
    - Recording a new sequence is possible only when the previous sequence has been deleted or if no sequence was recorded before (details below).
    - Once recording is complete, press the Config Mode Button to conclude the recording.
    - If you play a note beyond arpOli's range, a pause is inserted in the sequence.
    - While playing a sequence, press a keyboard key to shift the sequence's pitch (C3 results in no shift; F3 shifts a fourth, and so on).
    - While a sequence plays, pressing a key and holding the Config Button prevents shifting (the sequence maintains its previous shift status). The sequence will be adjusted at the current position, with the pressed note replacing the sequence note.
    - To halt the sequence, simply toggle off the sequencer switch. The recorded sequence remains intact unless a new sequence is recorded.
    - Holding the Config Button while switching to sequencer mode deletes the stored sequence.

## Patterns

arpOli allows storage of arpeggio patterns, facilitating dynamic musical sequences. The module retains the keys you press in a note buffer, including cases where the sustain pedal is pressed or arpeggiator hold mode is active. Note buffers can be ordered (upwards, downwards, or in the order you pressed the keys). Patterns are essentially sequences of simple instructions, guiding the selection of the next note to play from the note buffer.

A pattern is defined using instructions such as:
- "1": Play the next note in the buffer (increment the pointer by one).
- "2": Play the second-next note (increment the pointer by two).
- "3": Continue the pattern (extend as needed).
- "0": Repeat the last note.
- Negative numbers: Move backward in the note buffer (exact behavior may vary).
- "r": Randomly select a note from the buffer.
- "b": Return to

 the first note of the buffer (reset the pointer to 0).
- "A": The end of a pattern can lead to a B-"command," indicating the start of a new pattern.

Pattern cycling continues as long as the pattern continues. If the note pointer goes beyond the note buffer's range (smaller than 0 or larger than the buffer's length), the pointer is modified by the current length of the note buffer.

A simple example of a pattern:
- "1" -> Cycles through the note buffer.
- "0,1" -> Cycles through the buffer, playing each note twice.
- "R,B" -> The sequence begins with the first note, followed by a random note, and restarts.
- "2,-1" -> Presses all keys of a scale (experiment to observe results).

Patterns can have fixed lengths (distinct from the pattern description's length). When the pattern reaches this fixed length, the beginning of the next pattern is initiated with a B-"command," effectively restarting the note buffer.

For instance, consider a 5-note chord played on the keyboard (C1, G1, C2, E2, G2). For the first matrix pattern (only "1"), the sequence would be C1, G1, C2, E2, G2, C1, G1, C2, E2, G2, C1, G1, C2, E2, G2—repeating the note buffer, possibly not ideal for 4/4 time signatures. However, by assigning a fixed length of 8, the sequence would become C1, G1, C2, E2, G2, C1, G1, C2—generating an 8-note cycle with the first note of the buffer.

These patterns are programmable via the keyboard while in pattern change mode.
